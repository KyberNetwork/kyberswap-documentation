# Elastic Fee Collection

## Introduction

Whenever your active position goes into supporting trades, the market making fees are automatically reinvested into the pool. Consequently, fees are automatically compounded and accrued to your position. KyberSwap Elastic provides LPs the option to independently collect their accrued fees without affecting the underlying liquidity position. This means that LPs are able to reap the benefits of their auto-compounded yields at any time.
