# Elastic SDK

## Overview

Effortlessly interact with our [Elastic smart contracts](../kyberswap-elastic/contracts/) in a TypeScript environment via the KyberSwap Elastic SDK. Extending upon the [Core SDK's](../core-sdk/) OOP approach, the Elastic SDK provides developers with various abstractions required to conveniently and correctly structure Elastic smart contract trade and liquidity management operations for execution on-chain. This includes the safe handling of different data types (position, trades, etc.) as well as additional checks on math and smart contract encoding functions.

Please refer to the [Classes](classes/) section for the list of classes defined by the Core SDK.

_Note that our codebase uses the monicker `ProMM` to refer to our Elastic protocol._
