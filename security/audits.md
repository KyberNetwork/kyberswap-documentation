# Audits

## Overview

Being open and permissionless, KyberSwap understands the importance of security in a hostile on-chain environment where smart contract code ultimately controls the flow of digital assets. As such, KyberSwap has proactively implemented multiple security measures in an effort to harden our governance contracts. This includes third-party audits, audit contests involving independent security experts from the wider community, as well as a consistently evolving bug bounty program.
