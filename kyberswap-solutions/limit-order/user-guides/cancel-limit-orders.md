# Cancel Limit Orders

## Introduction

We understand that DeFi markets are volatile and users need to quickly react to such changes without incurring additional fees. KyberSwap Limit Orders enables you to cancel your orders at any time without incurring any gas fees. As long as the order is still active (not expired or fully filled), you can easily cancel your order on the KyberSwap Interface.&#x20;

For convenience, KyberSwap offers the option to cancel a single order or all active orders.

## How to cancel a specific limit order

You can manually cancel your order (or any unfilled portion of your order) before it expires.

### **Step 1**: Select active order

Find the active order you would like to update and click on its red Cancel button. The button icon looks like a trash can. This will bring up the Cancel Order screen.

### **Step 2**: Review cancellation

Review the information presented on the Cancel Order screen then click “Cancel” once you are satisfied. This is an onchain transaction that will require approval and gas.

Once the cancel transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, the cancelled order will appear under your Cancelled Orders in your Order History.
