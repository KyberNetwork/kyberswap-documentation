# KyberSwap FairFlow

FairFlow (FF) is a swap hook that enhances liquidity pools, built on Uniswap V4 and similar protocols. It is designed to help LPs earn additional yields from arbitrage value besides LP fees - while maintaining top-tier security.

The arbitrage value, which would typically be captured by external MEV bots, is now redistributed back to LPs through our Equilibrium Gain (EG) Sharing Program, funded by the FF hook. Furthermore, FF doesn’t require LP token staking to earn EG Sharing. So, LPs can use them in other DeFi protocols to unlock additional yield opportunities and utility.
