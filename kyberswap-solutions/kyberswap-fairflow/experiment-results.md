# Experiment Results

The KyberSwap team conducted multiple experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of FF. In this case, we will give LPs the example of ETH/USDC 0.05% pool. Full detail can be accessed [here](https://kybernetwork.notion.site/FairFlow-ETH-USDC-0-05-Experiment-Public-for-LPs-1fb26751887e80aea9afd10b146e7126?source=copy_link)

The results show that Uniswap v4 FairFlow consistently delivers a higher Earning/Value (%) for LPs compared to a standard Uniswap v4 pool across all timeframes. Notably, the longer the timeframe, the larger the performance gap.

After 200 hours of experiment, the APR of the Uniswap v4 FairFlow 0.05% pool reached nearly 80%.
