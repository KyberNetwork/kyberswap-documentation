# Developer Guides

The guides in the following section are targeted at application developers as well as smart contract integrators that are interested in building on top of the KyberSwap Aggregator ecosystem.

## Overview

KyberSwap Aggregator offers developers 2 options for integration:

* [**KyberSwap Widget**](../../kyberswap-widget/): An endlessly customizable widget that can be seamlessly integrated with a few lines of code.
* [**Aggregator API**](../aggregator-api-specification/): For developers that require more fine-tuned control when integrating swap functionality within their app.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Aggregator APIv2

The [EVM swap](../aggregator-api-specification/evm-swaps.md) API has been upgraded for more performant queries and the details behind the enhancement as well as the updated swap flows can be viewed on [Upgrading From APIv1 To APIv2](upgrading-from-apiv1-to-apiv2.md).
{% endhint %}

KyberSwap Aggregator implements a router contract which handles the complexity of routing and executing swaps atomically. Please refer to [Aggregator Contract Addresses](../contracts/aggregator-contract-addresses.md) for the full list of contracts which have been deployed across the supported chains.
