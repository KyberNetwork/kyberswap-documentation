# KyberSwap Aggregator

## Overview

KyberSwap Aggregator enables traders to swap at the best rates by seamlessly connecting users and applications to fractured liquidity across various decentralized exchanges and multiple chains. Through splitting and optimizing trade routes via both [AMM](../../getting-started/foundational-topics/decentralized-finance/automated-market-maker.md) and [Order Book](../../getting-started/foundational-topics/decentralized-finance/order-book.md) DEXs, KyberSwap Aggregator is able to objectively discover the most capital efficient liquidity sources thereby ensuring the best swap rates while encouraging greater market stability.

For developers, KyberSwap Aggregator provides you a set of [APIs](aggregator-api-specification/) which enables you to discover the best DEXs to route your swap via a single API call. Developers integrating KyberSwap also have the option of customising fees, as well as which token they would like to accept the fees in.
