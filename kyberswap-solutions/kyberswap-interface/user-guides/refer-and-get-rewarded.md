# Refer And Get Rewarded

## Introduction

We’ve created a simple Referral Program that will allow users to create and share referral links with their community. Whenever a trader uses a referral link to successfully trade on KyberSwap, the referrer will automatically and instantly receive a small commission from this trade (in the form of the input token), sent directly to their designated wallet address.

Through our referral program, we aim to drive wider adoption of KyberSwap by rewarding users for their references.

## Creating a referral link[​](https://docs.kyberswap.com/Classic/guides/referral-fee-program#creating-a-referral-link) <a href="#creating-a-referral-link" id="creating-a-referral-link"></a>

Referrers can create multiple referral links using our simple and intuitive ‘Referral’ dashboard which can be navigated to via the main menu or directly via [https://kyberswap.com/referral](https://kyberswap.com/referral). Referrers can configure their referral link as follows:

1. **Wallet Address (Required)**: Any referral commission you earn through your referral links will be directly sent to this wallet address. By default, we use your wallet address that is connected to KyberSwap, but you can change the address where you’d like to receive your referral commission.
2. **Referral Commission - % (Required)**: Any referral commission you earn through your referral links will be directly sent to this wallet address. By default, we use your wallet address that is connected to KyberSwap, but you can change the address where you’d like to receive your referral commission. \
   \
   _As an example, Lets say you configure your referral link with a referral commission of 0.05%. A trader uses your referral link to swap 2000 USDT to KNC on KyberSwap (BSC chain). The Referral Fees charged to the trader is 1 USDT (0.05% of 2000 USDT). You will automatically receive a referral commission of 1 USDT from this trade in your designated wallet address on BSC chain._
3. **Include Chain (Optional)**: You can also include the chain / network in your referral link so that traders who use your referral link are automatically re-directed to your desired chain on KyberSwap (By default, they will be re-directed to Ethereum chain). You will still earn commission fees from trades your referees make on other chains, as long as they use your referral link.
4. **Include Tokens (Optional)**: If the ‘Include Chain’ option is enabled, you can also specify the input and output tokens of the trade in your referral link. Whenever traders use your referral link with the chain and tokens, they will be automatically re-directed to your desired chain on KyberSwap and the input / output tokens in the Swap form will also be auto-selected. You will still earn commission fees from trades your referees make on other chains and with other tokens, as long as they use your referral link.

Once confirmed, a link will be provided, which you can copy and share with your fellow traders.

## Referral fee[​](https://docs.kyberswap.com/Classic/guides/referral-fee-program#referral-fee) <a href="#referral-fee" id="referral-fee"></a>

Before traders use a referral link to trade on KyberSwap, they will be able to see the referral fee applied to their trade. This referral fee will be sent directly to their referrer's wallet address.
