## Switching your active network

### **Step 1: Connect your wallet**

Upon [connecting your wallet](connect-your-wallet.md), KyberSwap would have automatically defaulted to the network per your wallet's setting. You can view the active network on the top right of the KyberSwap app.

In the example above, KyberSwap has connected to the Ethereum Mainnet as per the MetaMask setting.&#x20;

### **Step 2: Switch networks**

To change the network, you can select the dropdown which will display the full list of chain options for you to choose from. Please refer to [Supported Exchanges And Networks](../../../getting-started/supported-exchanges-and-networks.md) for the full details.

Select your preferred chain and you should then be prompted by your wallet to confirm the network change. If this is your first time connecting to a chain, your wallet provider should display the details of the chain for your verification. The below is an example of adding the Polygon chain and confirming the chain switch using MetaMask.

Once the switch has been approved, KyberSwap would then be connected to your selected network as can be verified via the active chain displayed in the top right of the KyberSwap app.
