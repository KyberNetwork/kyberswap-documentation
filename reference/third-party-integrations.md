# Third-Party Integrations

<summary>Transak</summary>

#### What is Transak?

Transak is a developer integration toolkit that enables onboarding of users to buy/sell crypto in any blockchain app, website or web plugin. Transak helps onboard mainstream users into dApp, protocol, game or wallet app.

#### Transak on [KyberSwap.com](http://kyberswap.com/)

Transak is integrated on KyberSwap through a browser integration that will redirect users to Transak to access their fiat on ramp services.

\*All of the KYC, regulation & compliance, fiat payment methods, and crypto coverage are solely handled by Transak.

Clicking "Buy Crypto" will bring you to a third party website, owned and operated by an independent party over which KyberSwap has no control ("[**Third Party Website**](https://global.transak.com/)").

For support, please contact Transak [**here**](https://support.transak.com/)**.**

<summary>Multichain Bridge</summary>

#### What is Multichain Bridge?

Multichain is the ultimate Router for web3. It is an infrastructure developed for arbitrary cross-chain interactions.

* It enables asset transfers between any two or more chains.
* It can work with pre-existing assets on blockchains, by using liquidity pools for those assets.
* It can also work with Bridged assets smart contract, where Multichain is responsible for minting assets on chains. This allows a generalisation of Bridges, so that assets are not restricted to having to return to their source chain before being sent to another chain. This makes for a cost effective solution for users, especially if the asset originated on Ethereum.
* The Router can include both native and Bridged assets. This allows inclusion of assets that might have been generated with a third party bridge (though we would need to understand what bridges were originally used).

#### Multichain on [KyberSwap.com](http://kyberswap.com/)

Multichain is integrated on KyberSwap through API front end functionality to provide users with an option to easily bridge tokens across chains.

<summary>Axelar x Squid</summary>

#### What is Axelar?

Axelar delivers secure cross-chain communication for Web3, enabling you to build Interchain dApps that grow beyond a single chain. _Secure_ means Axelar is built on proof-of-stake, the battle-tested approach used by Ethereum, Polygon, Cosmos, and more. _Cross-chain communication_ means you can build a complete experience for your users that lets them interact with any asset, any application, on any chain with one click.

Click [**here**](https://docs.axelar.dev/) for more information on Axelar.

#### What is axlUSDC?

axlUSDC is a wrapped, multi-chain representation of USDC, a dollar stablecoin. For each unit of axlUSDC, there is a unit of USDC locked in an Axelar Gateway on Ethereum. axlUSDC is secured by a dynamic validator set running delegated Proof-of-Stake, which holds key shares in the Axelar Gateways via multi-party cryptography.

Click [**here**](https://docs.axelar.dev/learn/axlusdc) for more information on axlUSDC.

#### What is Squid?

Squid is the cross-chain swap and liquidity routing protocol on [Axelar Network](https://axelar.network/).&#x20;

Squid utilises existing DEXs to swap and send any native token between chains. This can be done via their SDK, Front End or Contracts directly.

Swaps are composable with Axelar's generalised message passing, so Squid can enable _one-click_ transactions between any application and any user, using any asset.&#x20;

Buy NFTs from any marketplace, use multi-chain DeFi, play a game on another chain, all without signing multiple transactions or downloading multiple wallets.

#### Why Axelar x Squid?

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Squid\_LiquidityModel (1).jpg>)

By routing transactions through axlUSDC/USDC stable swap pools as well as USDC/native token pools, Squid supports swapping of any token combination across supported chains. Built on top of Axelar, Squid leverages Axelar's general cross-chain messaging abilities as well as its axlUSDC ecosystem to enable secure cross-chain token swaps.

#### Axelar x Squid on [KyberSwap.com](https://kyberswap.com/)

Squid is integrated on KyberSwap through API front end functionality to provide users with an option to conveniently swap tokens across the following supported chains:

* Ethereum (ChainID: 1)
* BSC (ChainID: 56)
* Arbitrum (ChainID: 42161)
* Polygon (ChainID: 137)
* Fantom (ChainID: 250)
* Avalanche (ChainID: 43114)
