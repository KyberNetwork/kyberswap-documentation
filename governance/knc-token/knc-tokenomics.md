## KNC Supply & Distribution

Launched on Ethereum in 2017, KNC adheres to the ERC-20 standard, meaning seamless compatibility with EVM-based smart contracts. Since September 2019, all vested KNC tokens for founders and advisors have been unlocked and distributed.

In 2021, in order to evolve with the DeFi landscape, [KNC was upgraded](https://blog.kyberswap.com/knc-token-migration-guide-2/) with additional functionality and flexibility, and the old token version was renamed KNCL (Kyber Network Crystal Legacy). Old KNCL holders can migrate to the current KNC version [here](https://kyberswap.com/kyberdao/stake-knc) at a 1:1 ratio. The KIP for the upgrade can be found [here](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-9.md).

In our docs, you can also find more information about our KNC [token contracts](https://docs.kyberswap.com/governance/knc-token/knc-contract-addresses#knc-token-contract-governance) and the relevant [audits](https://docs.kyberswap.com/reference/audits).

As of 27/10/23:

* KNC Max Supply (KNC + KNCL): 252,301,550
* KNC Total Supply: [228,782,331 KNC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kyber-network-crystal)
* KNC Circulating Supply: [170,542,470 KNC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kyber-network-crystal)
* KyberDAO Operator MultiSig (Signatories can be found [here](https://docs.kyberswap.com/governance/kyberdao/kyberdao-operator-multisig)): [\~12,243,146 KNC](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe6a7338cba0a1070adfb22c07115299605454713) (4.85%)
* KyberDAO Staking Contract: [\~45,996,714 KNC](https://etherscan.io/address/0xeadb96f1623176144eba2b24e35325220972b3bd) (18.2%)

## KNC Token Framework

The KNC token framework serves as an important guidepost ensuring that KNC remains a vital element securing the decentralization and sustainability of the KyberSwap Ecosystem. By aligning governance and product incentives, the KNC token framework intends to generate ever greater adoption of KNC through synergistic ecosystem growth.

The KyberSwap Ecosystem is composed of a myriad of stakeholders, each contributing to the KyberSwap network in various ways. Some obvious examples are:

* **KNC Token Holders**: Stake their KNC tokens in the KyberDAO to vote on the future of KNC. All changes must receive a majority vote via KIPs (Kyber Improvement Proposals) prior to being implemented.
* **Third Party Developers & Integrators**: Individuals or teams building on top of the KyberSwap ecosystem. By leveraging superior rates from KyberSwap, such integrators are also significantly expanding KyberSwap’s market depth and consequently facilitate trade volume.
* **Traders & Liquidity Providers**: Facilitates the seamless trading of tokens, including KNC, via KyberSwap. Ranging from market makers to users conducting a single trade, the aggregate effect of their actions result in a vibrant market for token swaps.

Given the multitude of user profiles, each with their own objectives, the ultimate goal of the KNC token framework is to steer development towards long-term ecosystem growth. This means aligning individual stakeholder objectives to drive KIPs which will increase KNC’s reach through lasting utility.

## KNC Utility

### **Governance Rights**

KNC holders who stake their tokens gain voting power within KyberDAO, enabling them to [vote on KIPs (Kyber Improvement Proposals)](https://kyberswap.com/kyberdao/vote) and influence key decisions that steer KyberSwap’s development and enhancements.

### **Voting Rewards**

In return for staking and participating in governance through voting, KNC holders receive a portion of protocol trading fees generated on [KyberSwap](https://kyberswap.com/). As more trades are carried out on KyberSwap, trading fees increase, resulting in more rewards for the KyberDAO. The more KNC staked by a user, the bigger their share of fees! Thus, there is a symbiotic relationship between KyberDAO stakeholders and KyberSwap’s success.

### **Gas Refunds**

With our new [Gas Refund Program](https://docs.kyberswap.com/governance/knc-token/gas-refund-program), KNC holders who stake their tokens on KyberDAO are also able to enjoy gas refunds when they trade with KyberSwap. The percentage of gas refunds are based on their KNC staking tier, offering more rewards for higher levels of commitment.

### **Liquidity Provision**

KNC holders can contribute to KyberSwap’s liquidity pools (e.g. KNC-USDC), providing valuable liquidity and earning fees from the trading activity that flows through the pool.

### **Liquidity Incentives**

KNC’s role extends to incentivizing liquidity providers through liquidity mining rewards, on top of standard trading fees. This provides more value to liquidity providers, bootstraps liquidity, and further amplifies ecosystem growth.

### **Collateral for Loans**

KNC is supported as a collateral asset on some lending/money market platforms for users to mint or borrow other tokens. For example, KNC can be deposited in [Aave](https://app.aave.com/) as collateral to borrow stablecoins or loaned out to users who want to borrow KNC (earning interest in the process). KNC can also be deposited in [QiDao vaults](https://app.mai.finance/vaults/137/knc) to borrow the MAI stablecoin.

## The future of KNC

As KyberSwap evolves and gets equipped with additional features, KNC’s utility is poised to grow even further. User feedback, community engagement, and ongoing developments will collectively shape the token’s future applications.
