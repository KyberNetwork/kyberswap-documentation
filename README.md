# Introduction to KyberSwap

Founded on [decentralized finance](getting-started/foundational-topics/decentralized-finance/) (DeFi) principles of open access, KyberSwap is a multichain [aggregator](getting-started/foundational-topics/decentralized-finance/dex-aggregator.md) and DeFi hub that empowers users with the insights and tools to trade without intermediaries. All the above while being fast, secure, and easy-to-use. Whichever your path to financial autonomy, KyberSwap has got you covered.

With more than 100+ projects building on top of KyberSwap, our solutions have facilitated over US$20B in transactions for thousands of traders since its inception. KyberSwap's development is governed by the [KyberDAO](governance/kyberdao/), a community platform that empowers [KNC](governance/knc-token/) (Kyber Network Crystal) token holders to [vote](https://kyberswap.com/kyberdao/vote) on or [create](https://kyberswap.canny.io/feature-request) proposals which will go on to influence KyberSwap's roadmap. As DeFi's open and permissionless liquidity backbone, KyberSwap continues to generate synergies across its ever expanding ecosystem which now comprises of more than [100 connected projects across 17 chains](getting-started/supported-exchanges-and-networks.md).
