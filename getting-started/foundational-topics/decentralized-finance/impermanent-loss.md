# Impermanent Loss

## Overview

Impermanent loss is a concept that arises in decentralized finance (DeFi), which refers to the potential temporary reduction in capital that a liquidity provider (LP) can experience when participating in a DeFi protocol.

In DeFi, LPs contribute funds to a liquidity pool, which allows users to buy and sell a particular asset on a decentralized exchange (DEX). The liquidity provider earns a share of the trading fees generated by the DEX in return for their contribution. However, the value of the assets in the liquidity pool can fluctuate over time, which naturally results in buying/selling activity in the pool, changing the original balance of liquidity provided.

As a result, the total value of the capital that the LP holds in the pool could decrease relative to the potential total value of the capital had they held their assets and chosen not to participate in the liquidity pool in the first place, and this temporary reduction of capital is known as Impermanent Loss.

It is important to note that impermanent loss is not a guaranteed outcome and can be mitigated through proper risk management strategies, such as diversifying the assets in the liquidity pool or rebalancing the pool regularly. Additionally, some DeFi protocols offer mechanisms to compensate liquidity providers for impermanent loss, such as Yield Farming rewards.
