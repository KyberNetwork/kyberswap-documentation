Chains and DEXs

The KyberSwap product suite has been deployed across the majority of the most established DeFi chains. Whichever your preferred chain, the [KyberSwap Aggregator](../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-aggregator/) ensures the best swap rates by aggregating liquidity across the most established [DEXs](../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-aggregator/dex-ids.md) deployed on that chain. Or make use of [KyberSwap Zap as a Service](../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-zap-as-a-service/) to effortlessly add liquidity into any concentrated liquidity protocol using any tokens, while also minimizing price impact through integration with the KyberSwap aggregator.

**DEX filtering**

For traders, you can specify which DEXs are considered when computing your swap route by Customizing Trade Parameters directly on the [KyberSwap Interface](../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-interface/).

For developers integrating with the [KyberSwap Aggregator](../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-aggregator/), please refer to [DEX IDs](../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-aggregator/dex-ids.md) for internal mapping of DEXs used for filtering via the [API](../kyberswap-solutions/kyberswap-aggregator/aggregator-api-specification/).
